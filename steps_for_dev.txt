created a new user in PostgreSQL
created a new database named devteams
created all relations required and inserted data

created a new folder called devteams_website
created a new sub folder called server
shifted to server folder

prisma is a database mapping tool and can be used for better interactions with database via API like structures
installed prisma as devDependency - as they are not required at the production level
installed prisma/client dependency
run prisma using npx as it stands for node execution and not management
changed the postgressql database url in the .env file after the prisma was initiated
use npx prisma db pull to attach the database to prisma schema
generated the prisma client to make a bridge for communication
there will be a generated folder created

npm install typescript @types/node --save-dev ts-node
@types/node is used to help typescript with node.js and ts-node to compile and run ts files faster
now create a folder src and index.ts inside that folder
import PrismaClient from the ../generated/prisma
create a new prismaclient and a function to check if tables values can extracted using findMany()
to run and check if it works, first change the following in tsconfig.json
change type to commonjs
comment the line verbatimmodulesyntax: true
then run the command: npx ts-node src/index.ts

next install apollo-server graphql in the server folder
create 2 files in src as schema.ts and resolvers.ts
under schema.ts import gql from apollo-server and export a typDefs const as string with ``
inside the string we define a Student structure and what Query we want
in the resolvers file: we should resolve the queries asked in the schema file
so in the students query return all the students values using prisma findMany
in the index.ts clear all content
import typDefs and resolver and apolloserver
have a main or start function async
inside: create a new ApolloServer with parameters typeDefs and resolvers
listen to the server and extract the url and just console log url to check if its running
